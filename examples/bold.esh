# This file demonstrates what the point of bold.c is, and some very
# handy tricks with files.
#
# Namely, this will cause the standard error to be printed in bold red
# on the terminal.
#
# The only problem with this is that it causes `less' to behave very
# strangely, but this seems to be a bug in `less'.
