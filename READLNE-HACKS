Only one readline hack so far: 

You can use control-j to insert a literal newline. (i.e. when you
want to type long definitions interactively.)

One non-readline hack: typing Control-C while the shell is evaluating 
commands will take you back to the prompt. This is useful when you
have inadvertently entered an infinite loop.
