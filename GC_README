  The much-improved refcounter code in esh 0.5 can be used as a drop-in
replacement for malloc/free. It has been written in such a way as to be
imdependent of esh itself. Simply compile and link gc.c along with the
rest of your program, and replace calls to "malloc" with "gc_alloc",
and "free" with "gc_free".
