Title: esh: the easy shell
Author: Edward Betts <edward@debian.org>
Abstract: esh was primarily written out of a need for a simple and lightweight 
 shell for Unix. As such, it deviates completely from all of the traditional
 shells, opting instead for a Lisp-like syntax. This allows exceptionally 
 small size, both in terms of lines of code and memory consumption, while
 retaining remarkable flexibility and programmability.
