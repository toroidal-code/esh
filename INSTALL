Thanks to Ryan Weaver for it.)


1. Edit the Makefile to set compilation flags and header locations.
   Pay attention to the "INC=..." and "LIB=..." lines; that's where you
   put the location of your readline library.

   Note: If you get linking errors, something along the lines of
   "tputs" and "tgetflag" missing, try compiling with "-ltermcap" in the
   "LIB=" line. This seems to be an idiosyncracy of readline -- if someone
   can clue me in why some compilations of readline need this, I'll be
   greatful.

   Note that the size of the executable triples on my Linux/glibc
   system when compiled with debugging, so you might want to turn it off.

2. Type "make".

3. Copy "esh" to anywhere you want to install the shell. The shell does
   not depend on any other files.
   
4. The directory "emacs" contains an emacs editing mode for shell scripts.
   The directory "examples" contains some example shell scripts.
   The directory "doc" has the info and html documentation.
